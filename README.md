## Description

The goal of this application is to build a blog where people can log in to write their own posts and comment on the posts of others.

## Usage

This application can be used by anyone looking to communicate with others through blog posts and comments.

## What I did

Using the controller-model-view methodology, I built a site to allow users to write, comment on and delete blog posts.

## What I learned

I learned about how to incorporate .handlebars HTML files into my coding, as well as how to hash user passwords.
